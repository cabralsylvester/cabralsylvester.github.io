Hello, my name is Cabral Sylvester.

This portfolio page was created while I was a student at General Assembly in Washington DC.

My General Assembly cohort titled "WDI-14" (Web Development Immersive 14) began on Jan 17th & ended on April 7th.

This portfolio possesses 3 projects:

1. "Farmart" - (Angular, Rails, CSS, Bootstrap) 
2. "Budget App" - (Javascript, JQuery, CSS, Bootstrap, HTML)
3. "Dice Game" - (Javascript, JQuery, CSS, Bootstrap, HTML))
